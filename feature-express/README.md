Example of using Cucumber with Feature express and Allure Report, hosted on AWS S3.

## What is feature-express?

Feature-express is a simple way for you to expose your features to all stakeholders in an organized and clean way.
When we develop our features, they are usually in our private repositories, and we need to grant access so that stakeholders can view the developed scenarios.

## Preconditions

- Node configured

## Commands

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Run feature-Express locally

```
npm run feature-express
```

- Generating a Static Build

```
npm run build-feature-express
```
